# DRLinBlackjack
some basic algorithm in Reinforcement Learning based on TF1.X
Env is Blackjack_, plotting.py for plot different value of state from kinds of algorithm.

Blackjack is a popular game. The policy of dealer in the environment is to keep taking "hit" action while sum of cards is lower than 17.
Goal of the RL algorithm is to calculate the value of every state in the environment and to return a most valuable action at the current scenario.
The result is demonstrated by the value figure of every state.
